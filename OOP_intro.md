How to OOP

### Class
What is a class? A class is like a cookie cutter. The cookie cutter is not the cookie. It's a blueprint for objects but not the object itself. 

What can you do with a cookie? 
    - eat it!

### Methods
The actions or how an object behaves. 

So in the above example, .eat_cookie() could be a method inside the class Cookie.
