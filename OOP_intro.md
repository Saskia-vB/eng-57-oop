What is OOP
Why OOP

How to OOP

### Class
What is a class? A class is like a cookie cutter. The cookie cutter is not the cookie. It's a blueprint for objects but not the object itself. 

What can you do with a cookie? 
    - eat it!

### Methods
The actions or how an object behaves. 

So in the above example, .eat_cookie() could be a method inside the class Cookie.

### Instance
- occurence
- is the cookie

### Syntax
```python

class Dog():

    def __init__(self, attr1, attr2, optional_attri='default'):
        self.attribute_1= attri1, 
        self.attribute_2= attri2,
        self.attribute_3= optional_attri,

    def method_name(self, arg1):
        #complex block
        arg1 += arg1 + 1
        return arg1


```

- capitals are for classes

## 4 Pillars

### Inheritance
The ability of subclass to inherit all the behaviour and method from parent class. 
One of the core reasons to use OOP, because it means you write less code. In reality this is debatable, as you end up having to adapt a lot of methods.It also depends how good of a coder you are and your ability to abstract effectively. 

### Abstraction
- good naming
- good documentation - mention what methods and how to use them
- use of inheritance

### Polymorphism
- what is class polymorphism
- what is method polymorphism
